Pinball Prison Blues
Ever (G)since I was a young boy… I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton… I (G7) must have played them all
I (C)ain't seen nothing like him… In (G)any amusement hall...
That (D7)deaf, dumb and blind kid...
Sure plays a-mean pin-(G)ball!

He (G)stands like a statue… becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers… (G7) always playing clean
He (C)plays by intuition… The di(G)git counters fall...
That (D7)deaf, dumb and blind kid...
Sure plays a-mean pin-(G)ball!

He (G)ain't got no distractions… can't hear those buzzers ‘n’ bells
Don't see no lights a flashin’… (G7) plays by sense of smell
(C)Always gets a replay… (G)never seen him fall
That (D7)deaf, dumb and blind kid...
Sure plays a-mean pin-(G)ball!

Even (G)on my favorite table… he can beat my best
His disciples lead him in… and (G7) he just does the rest
He's got (C)crazy flipper fingers… (G)never seen him fall...
That (D7)deaf, dumb and blind kid...
Sure plays a-mean pin-(G)ball!
