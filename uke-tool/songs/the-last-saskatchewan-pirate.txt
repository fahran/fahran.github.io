The Last Saskatchewan Pirate
Well I (G)used to be a farmer and I (C)made a (D)living (G)fine
I (C)had a little (G)stretch of land a(D)long the CP line
But (G)times went by and though I tried the (C)money (D)wasn't (G)there
And (C)bankers came and (G)took my land and (D)told me "Fair is (G)Fair"
I (Em)looked for every kind of job (A)the answer always "No",
(Em)"Hire you now" they'd always laugh, (D)"We just let Twenty go!" [Haha]
The (Em)government, they promised me a (A)measley little sum,
But (Em)I've got too much pride to end up (D)just another bum!     
(C)Then I thought who gives a damn if all the jobs are gone(G),
(D)I'm gonna be a pirate, on the river (D7)Saskatchewan!

[chorus]
And it's a Heave (G)[HO!] High (G)[HO!] (C)Comin' (D)down the (G)plains,
(C)Stealin' Wheat and (G)Barley and (D)all the other grains,
And it's a Ho (G)[HEY!] High (G)[HEY!] (C)Farmers (D)bar yer (G)doors,
When you (C)see the Jolly (G)Roger on (D)Regina's mighty (G)shores.

Well you (G)think the local farmers would (C)know that (D)I'm at (G)large,
But (C)just the other (G)day I found an (D)unprotected barge,
I (G)snuck up right behind them and (C)they were (D)none the (G)wiser,
I (C)rammed their ship and (G)sank it and I (D)stole their (G)Fertilizer
A (Em)Bridge outside of Moosejaw (A)spans the mighty river,
(Em)Farmers cross in so much fear their (D)stomach's are a quiver,
(Em)'Cause they know that Tractor Jack is (A)hiding in the bay,
I'll (Em)jump the bridge and knock em cold and (D)sail off with their (D7)Hay!

Well (G)Mountie Bob he chased me he was (C)always (D)at my (G)throat,
He (C)followed on the (G)shorelines 'cause he (D)didn't own a boat,
But (G)cut-backs were a comin' and the (C)Mountie (D)lost his (G)job,
So (C)now he's sailin' (G)with me and we (D)call him Salty (G)Bob!
A (Em)Swingin' Sword and Skull and Bones are (A)pleasant company,

I (Em)never pay my Income Tax and (D)screw the VAT [SCREW IT!]
(Em)Salin' down to Saskatoon, the (A)Terror of the Sea,
If you (Em)wanna reach the Co-op boy you (D)gotta get by (D7)me!

Well (G)pirate life's appealing but you (C)don't just (D)find it (G)here,
I (C)hear that down in (G)Lambeth there's a band of (D)buccaneers,
Their (G)ship is the Tamesis, all of (C)London (D)is their (G)prey,
And you'd (C)better bring your (G)uke if you (D)drop in on a (G)Wednesday.

Well (Em)Winter is a comin' and a (A)chill is in the breeze,
My (Em)pirate days are over once the (D)river starts to freeze,
But (Em)I'll be back in Spring time but (A)now I have to go,
I (Em)hear there's lots of plundering down in New (D)Mexi(D7)co!
